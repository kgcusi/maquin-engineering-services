> _Last updated: 2026-06-23 — **Stage 2 (Project Tracking) — implemented; in MANUAL REVIEW** on branch `stage-2-project-tracking` (NOT merged to `main`, not signed off). Built in 4 vertical slices. **(0) Spine:** migration `0012` (projects · project_members · phases · tasks · daily_reports + dsr_manpower/equipment/materials/issues; 3 pgEnums; progress `CHECK(0..100)`; partial index on open past-due tasks; DSR photos reuse the polymorphic `attachments` table — no `dsr_photos`), the **`QA_QC_ENGINEER`** role (visible, non-admin — NOT in Better Auth `adminRoles`) + scoped `task.manage` for engineers + reserved `inspection.*`, the `assertProjectAccess`/`projectAccessWhere` scoping pair, and designed `(app)` `not-found`/`error` pages. **(1) Projects:** admin CRUD, validated status state machine, multi-engineer teams (1 LEAD + N MEMBER) via `project_members`, detail hub (Overview/Phases&Tasks/Daily Reports/Documents/Notes), `project.*` notifications. **(2) Phases & Tasks:** scoped CRUD, on-write progress roll-up (`FOR UPDATE` phase→project, manual-pin aware), derived status, inline progress quick-path, phase-grouped list. **(3) Daily Site Reports:** collision-safe create + carry-forward, debounced autosave, submit/admin-reopen, photos upload-on-pick, `dsr.submitted`/`dsr.issue.flagged`; the dispatcher gained `PROJECT:*` resolution + actor-exclusion. **(4)** nightly `task.delayed` cron + PENDING-file **orphan reaper** + 27 new unit tests (**142 total**). Engineers are query-scoped to assigned projects everywhere; a guessed id 404s. **Inspection module now implemented** (uncommitted) — project Inspections tab, request → Pass/Fail, migration `0014`. Prior: **Stage 1 (Core System) complete** · **Stage 0 gate closed** (live DB migrated · seeded · acceptance passed). **2026-06-23 audit:** Stage 1 + 2 verified claim-by-claim against the code; corrected STATUS drift (cron is daily not 5-min, suppliers detail page exists, typed employee docs descoped → simple name+file, email sending is wired, inspection module shipped), closed the bulk-edit task-assignment notification gap, restored the cookie cache to the documented 60s, and shipped a Settings → Notifications enable panel + manual "Process queue now" drain._

## You are here

**Stage 0 — Foundation: ✅ COMPLETE.** The app boots, builds green (`typecheck` +
`lint` + `build` pass with Cache Components), and has auth/db/ui, the foundation
libs + schema, and the bootstrap seed in place. The **"Stage 0 full" gate is now
closed**: Neon is provisioned, all migrations applied, and the seed run (hidden
webmaster + admin) against the live DB, with the [`docs/16`](docs/16-tech-decisions.md)
§2 **acceptance check** passing — a multi-statement `db.transaction()` **and** a
prepared-heavy query both succeed against the **pooled** URL. Resend/R2/cron stay
deferred until the notifications/files features need them.

**Stage 1 — Core System: ✅ COMPLETE.** All slices shipped: the **auth session-caching layer**
(cookie cache + `getFreshSession` + optimistic `proxy.ts`), **User Management**
(admin CRUD + deactivate, audited, hidden webmaster filtered out), the
**Audit Log viewer** (`/audit`) — a filterable, paginated, read-only view over the
immutable `audit_logs` those actions already write — and **System Settings**
(`/settings`, **webmaster-only**): firm timezone + currency over `app_settings`, the
app's first `use cache` reader, with the timezone now applied across rendered
timestamps; the same page now stores **Resend email-delivery credentials** (sender +
API key) with a **connection test that sends no email**; the saved sender is now used to
deliver enabled notification events. Brand assets (logos + adaptive favicon) are
wired into the shell.

The **Directory** is now in: **clients**, **suppliers**, and **employees** with
full CRUD, search, archive/restore (soft-delete), and an employee active toggle —
all audited. Clients have a detail page with **Info / Documents / Notes / Projects**
tabs, where Documents runs on a **reusable file-upload pipeline** (R2 presigned PUT →
direct browser upload → confirm) over the polymorphic `files`/`attachments` tables,
and Notes over the polymorphic `notes` table. The pipeline + `<FileUploader>` /
`<AttachmentList>` / `<NotesPanel>` are entity-agnostic, ready for DSR photos and
expense receipts in later stages.

The **Notifications scaffold (core)** has now landed — Stage 1's last item. The
deliver side is in: `notifications` + `notification_settings` tables (`0010`), a
data-driven **dispatcher** (drains the `outbox` → resolves `ROLE:*`/`USER:*`
recipients → creates rows; in-app appears immediately, email queues, deduped by
`idempotency_key`, every send audited), a `CRON_SECRET`-protected **Vercel Cron
drain** (`/api/cron/notifications` + `vercel.json`, **daily at 00:00 UTC** — Vercel Hobby allows only daily crons; enabled events can also be flushed on demand from **Settings → Notifications → "Process queue now"**), a generic **React
Email** template (`src/emails/`), an **in-app bell** streamed into the topbar
(mark-read / mark-all), and a webmaster-only **"Send test notification"** panel in
Settings that runs the whole pipeline end-to-end. The `sendEmail()` path now uses
the **Settings-managed Resend key** (env fallback). Catalog is seeded **inert**
(`enabled=false`) — nothing emails real people until the firm enables an event.

**Deferred (by decision):** the Resend **webhook/Svix** handler (delivered/bounced/
complained), the **digest-aggregation** cron, **per-user preferences**, and wiring
**real domain events** — those land per-module in Stage 2+ as their sources arrive.

**Stage 2 — Project Tracking: 🚧 IMPLEMENTED — IN MANUAL REVIEW** (branch `stage-2-project-tracking`, NOT merged). The firm's
core operational loop is in: an admin creates a **project**, assigns a **team** (one LEAD +
many MEMBER engineers) via `project_members`, and those engineers — and only those — see it
everywhere (`assertProjectAccess` on every write + membership-baked reads; a guessed/forbidden
id renders the designed 404, never data). Each project has **phases & tasks** with on-write
**progress roll-up** (task → phase → project, `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` so concurrent edits can't
lose an update; skipped when `progress_is_manual`), **derived** task/phase status (never stored),
and assigned engineers create/manage tasks (scoped `task.manage`) plus a narrow assignee
progress quick-path. Engineers file **Daily Site Reports** (one per project per day, collision-safe;
weather/work/manpower/equipment/materials/issues/photos/next-day) with debounced autosave,
carry-forward of crew + equipment, **photo upload-on-pick** over the reusable file pipeline, and
submit → SUBMITTED (admin re-opens, audited). A **nightly cron** flags newly past-due tasks once
(`task.delayed`); a second cron reaps abandoned PENDING uploads. Project/DSR events
(`project.*`, `dsr.submitted`, `dsr.issue.flagged`) emit through the outbox — the dispatcher now
resolves `PROJECT:*` recipients and **excludes the actor** — seeded **inert** until the firm
enables them. The **`QA_QC_ENGINEER`** role, the `INSPECTOR` membership value, and reserved
`inspection.*` keys ship now; the **inspection module is now implemented** (uncommitted) —
a project-scoped **Inspections** tab where an engineer requests an inspection (naming a QA/QC
engineer, which grants them INSPECTOR membership) and the QA/QC engineer records **Pass/Fail +
remarks**; advisory (never blocks completion); emits `inspection.requested`/`inspection.completed`
(migration `0014`). **Post-build hardening (in review, uncommitted):** fixed the user-role schema so QA/QC is selectable (it had drifted from `ASSIGNABLE_ROLES`), surfaced the **Projects** sidebar item for engineers/QA-QC (it was hidden + admin-only), and resolved audit findings — **firm-timezone "today"** for the DSR day-key / delayed scan / completed dates (was UTC), **race-safe DSR create** (`onConflictDoNothing` + resume), **task-assignee membership validation** in the action, a **deadlock-safe** cross-phase roll-up (sorted lock order), and **access-check-before-fetch** on the detail pages. Deferred: a partial `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` unique index on `daily_reports` (latent until a DSR-delete path ships). **Up next — Stage 3 (Inventory):**
the ledger engine, where DSR material usage (`dsr_materials.id` is already the stable
`source_id`) finally posts `−USAGE`.

**Stage 2 addendum — Templates & Inspection checklists: 🚧 IMPLEMENTED — gate-green, NOT yet
migrated/runtime-verified.** A planning round (grilled & locked 2026-06-23, [`docs/17`](docs/17-audit-decisions.md)
§10.16–10.17) added two presets capabilities, **documented first** in [`docs/02`](docs/02-data-model.md)
§4.5–4.6 + [`docs/04`](docs/04-modules.md) §5.8a/§5.10a, then built. **(1) Project Templates** —
admin-authored phase(+`duration_days`)/task(+`weight_pct`) skeletons (`project_templates` ·
`_phases` · `_tasks`, migration **`0016`**); a `template.*`-guarded module (cached
`getActiveTemplatesWithTree`, CRUD actions, the **unit-tested** calendar-day `instantiateTemplate`
service); Setup → **Templates** admin page + nested editor; **"Start from template"** picker +
**adjustable review step** in project creation (one tx, snapshot not link); and **"Apply template"**
on an empty project's Phases tab. The review step also lets you add **ad-hoc tasks under existing
phases** (phases stay the template's) — name-only, seeded alongside the template tasks. **(2) Inspection checklists + re-inspection history** —
`inspection_checklists`/`_items` presets + `inspection_attempts`/`inspection_item_results` +
`inspections.checklist_id` (migration **`0017`**); `INSPECTION_ITEM_RESULTS` (PASS/FAIL/NA);
`checklist.*` permissions; Setup → **Checklists** admin page; the inspection **record action rewritten
to append an attempt** (reopen-in-place, never a new request) with per-item photos re-homed from the
inspection to the item-result row; outcome dialog gains the checklist picker + per-item
PASS/FAIL/NA + remarks + photos (QA/QC still sets the overall result), and the list gains a
**Re-inspect** button + lazy **history timeline**. Nav entries for both. **Gate:** `typecheck` +
`lint` + `build` clean; **185 unit tests pass** (+ template date-math, checklist/inspection schema,
`canReinspect`). **Still to do (not done):** run **`pnpm db:migrate`** to apply `0016`+`0017` to the
live DB (blocked from the agent — apply manually), and an **authenticated runtime pass** (per-item
photos also need R2 provisioned + bucket CORS).

## What's built (Stage 0 — code side)

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) with **Cache Components** (`cacheComponents: true`) — `next.config.ts`.
- **pnpm** · TypeScript · **Tailwind v4** · **shadcn** (Base UI / `base-nova`) + a deliberate engineering-green accent (green/white) · **Lucide**.
- **Better Auth** configured (admin plugin, **signup disabled**, `role`/`is_active`/`employee_id`) + **generated Drizzle auth schema** (`src/db/schema/auth.ts`) — `password` lives in `account` (not user).
- **Drizzle client** (`src/db/client.ts`: postgres-js, pooled, `prepare:false`, txn-capable) + `drizzle.config.ts` (unpooled).
- **App shell**: `/login` (double-submit-safe form), gated `/dashboard` (Suspense + fail-closed `AuthGate`), placeholder pages for projects/inventory/finance/reports, grouped sidebar/topbar, dark mode.
- **Auth-caching path** (DB-thrifty): Better Auth **cookie cache** (60s signed snapshot) so the read gate `getSession()` skips the DB; **`getFreshSession()`** (DB-authoritative) backs the `action()` write guard; optimistic **`src/proxy.ts`** (zero-DB cookie-presence redirect); `nextCookies()` wired last. Three layers: proxy (optimistic) → `AuthGate` (cached read) → `action()` (fresh DB on writes).
- **Tooling**: ESLint (+ `unused-imports` = no dead code) · Prettier · husky + lint-staged · `.claude/commands.json` · `.env.example`.
- **Folder skeleton** per [`docs/01`](docs/01-architecture.md) §4 (`src/modules/*`, `emails/`, `workers/`, `drizzle/migrations/`).
- **Foundation libs** (`src/lib/`): `rbac` (permission keys + roles + the `action()` Server-Action guard + the hidden **`WEBMASTER`** super-bundle / `HIDDEN_ROLES` + `visibleUserWhere`), `money` (Money VO + Drizzle money/quantity types), `events` (cache-tag taxonomy + outbox emitter), `audit`, `refcodes`, `mailer` (Resend), `storage` (R2 presign).
- **Foundation schema + migration** (`src/db/schema/`): `ref_counters`, `audit_logs` (+ append-only DB trigger), `outbox`, `files`, `attachments`, `notes` — `drizzle/migrations/0000`+`0001`+`0002` generated (**not yet applied**). `0002` widens `audit_logs.entity_id` to `text` (entity ids are heterogeneous: Better Auth text ids + our uuids).
- **Seed** (`src/db/seed.ts`): idempotent **hidden WEBMASTER** superuser + **ADMIN**, created from env (`SEED_WEBMASTER_*` / `SEED_ADMIN_*`) via `pnpm db:seed`.

## What's built (Stage 1 — code side)

- **User Management** (`src/modules/users/` + `/users`): admin **create / edit / deactivate / reactivate** through the guarded `action()` wrapper, every change **audited**; reads apply `visibleUserWhere()` so the hidden webmaster never appears; **deactivation deletes the user's `session` rows in-tx** (the deactivation-revoke contract). Built with **TanStack Table** + **react-hook-form** + Zod; designed empty/loading/error states; double-submit-safe.
- **Audit Log viewer** (`src/modules/audit/` + `/audit`): a **read-only**, server-paginated view over the append-only `audit_logs`. Searchable **Combobox** filters for actor + action, a Select for entity type, and **date pickers** for the range — all URL-driven so the page stays dynamic; newest-first, mobile-stacking filters + horizontally-scrollable table, with a per-row **diff** detail dialog. Action/entity keys render as **humanized labels** (`user.deactivated` → "User Deactivated", `src/modules/audit/labels.ts`). **No `action()` / Server Actions** — audit is written elsewhere, in-tx. Actor shows the real account and is **viewer-aware**: a webmaster viewer sees real names; for everyone else the hidden webmaster is masked as **"System"** and absent from the actor filter (preserves the hidden-superuser invariant). The reusable `getEntityAuditTrail()` query ships now for Stage 2+ per-entity "History" panels.
- **New shared UI primitives** (`src/components/ui/`): `Combobox` (searchable single-select on Base UI, shows the item **label** not its value) and `DatePicker` / `DateTimePicker` (a real **calendar popover** built on Base UI `Popover` + a hand-rolled month grid — no native date input, no extra deps; supports min/max, Today/Clear). Reuse these app-wide.
- **RBAC-in-UI**: topbar **sign-out** user-menu (streamed) + **permission-aware grouped sidebar nav** (the Setup section collapses away for engineers). Page-level gate `requirePagePermission()` (`src/lib/page-guards.ts`).
- **Authorization model split** for client/test safety: pure `src/lib/roles.ts` + `src/lib/permissions.ts` (no server deps) re-exported by `src/lib/rbac.ts` (which keeps the DB-coupled `action()` + `visibleUserWhere`). `action()` now maps `ActionError` to clean user-facing messages.
- **System Settings** (`src/modules/settings/` + `src/lib/settings.ts` + `/settings`): **webmaster-only** firm **timezone + currency** over the `app_settings` key/value table (migration `0004`). `getSettings()` is the app's **first `use cache` reader** (`cacheTag('settings')` / `cacheLife('max')`); `updateSettingsAction` upserts + audits (`settings.updated`) + invalidates **post-commit** (`revalidate`). Timezone threads through a pure `src/lib/datetime.ts` into the audit + users tables. `settings.view`/`settings.manage` are excluded from the ADMIN bundle (`WEBMASTER_ONLY`), so admins are redirected and the nav item is hidden.
- **Email-delivery credentials** (Settings → "Email delivery", **webmaster-only**, reusing `settings.manage`): Resend **sender + API key** stored as `app_settings` rows (no migration — key/value table) via `updateEmailSettingsAction`, plus a **`testEmailConnectionAction`** that validates the saved key with `resend.domains.list()` and **sends no email**. The API key is a **secret**: it never enters the cached `getSettings()` reader (a separate non-cached `getEmailConfig()` returns only a masked `re_••••wxyz` hint), is never echoed to the client (blank field = keep), and is **redacted in the audit diff**. Pure registry/masking in `src/lib/email-settings.ts`; the Resend probe lives in `src/lib/mailer.ts` (`checkResendConnection`). **Sending is now wired** — enabled notification events deliver email through this sender via the dispatcher's `deliverQueued`.
- **Directory** (`src/modules/{clients,suppliers,employees}/` + `/clients`, `/suppliers`, `/employees`, **admin-gated**): full CRUD via the guarded `action()` wrapper, **search**, and a **Delete** — all **audited**; TanStack Table + react-hook-form + Zod; designed empty/loading states; double-submit-safe. All three entities behave identically: **Edit + Delete** only (no archive/restore UI). **Delete is a soft delete** under the hood (`deleted_at`, shared `DeleteConfirm`) so FK-referencing rows in later stages keep the name/history; deleted records are hidden from lists (no restore UI). Migration **`0005`** adds `clients`/`suppliers`/`employees`. **Clients**, **Suppliers**, and **Employees** have detail pages (`/clients/[id]`, `/suppliers/[id]`, `/employees/[id]`) with tabs; the Clients **Projects** tab lists that client's projects.
- **Employees — HR/Payroll foundation** (`0006`/`0007`): added `position` (a **creatable** searchable picker — pick existing or type new, `src/components/ui/creatable-combobox.tsx`), `employment_type`, `date_hired`, `address`, and a pay **`rate`** (DECIMAL(14,2) Money VO, exposed to the client as a plain string) with a `rate_unit` (Daily/Monthly/Hourly); **dropped `trade_code`**. `is_active` is kept in the DB **reserved** for the future HR module (employed vs separated) but is NOT surfaced in the UI — employees are Edit + Delete like the rest. Detail tabs: **Info / Documents / Notes**. Documents use the same **simple name+file** pipeline as clients — the typed-document feature (`attachments.kind`) was **descoped** and that column is currently unused.
- **Reusable file-upload pipeline** (`src/lib/uploads.ts` + `src/lib/storage.ts` + `src/modules/files/`): R2 **presign → direct browser PUT → confirm (HEAD)** over the polymorphic `files`/`attachments` tables; server-side mime allowlist + 15 MB cap; per-consumer guarded actions keep the static-permission `action()` invariant; entity-agnostic `<FileUploader>` / `<AttachmentList>` (+ `<NotesPanel>` over polymorphic `notes`) ready for DSR photos / receipts later. **Client documents are the first consumer.** End-to-end upload **verifies later** — needs **R2 provisioned + bucket CORS** (PUT from the app origin); the pure guards are unit-tested now.
- **Notifications scaffold — core** (`src/modules/notifications/` + `src/lib/notification-events.ts` + `src/emails/` + `0010`): a **data-driven** pipeline over the existing `outbox`. The `notifications` (status enum `QUEUED/SENT/DELIVERED/BOUNCED/COMPLAINED/FAILED/READ`, dedup `idempotency_key`, backoff) + `notification_settings` (per-event `enabled`/`channels`/`recipient_rule`/`mode`, seeded **inert**) tables land in `0010`. The **dispatcher** (`service.ts`, drained by **Vercel Cron** `/api/cron/notifications` + `vercel.json`, `CRON_SECRET`-guarded) resolves `ROLE:*`/`USER:*` recipients (`PROJECT:*` waits for Stage 2), creates rows (in-app appears immediately, email queues), and sends EMAIL via Resend — **deduped** and **audited** (`notification.sent`). A generic **React Email** template (`notification-email.tsx` + shared `layout.tsx`) with deep links; `sendEmail()` now uses the **Settings-managed Resend key** (env fallback). An **in-app bell** streams into the topbar (`notification-bell.tsx`, unread badge + mark-read / mark-all, `notification.view` for all roles) and a webmaster-only **"Send test notification"** panel runs the pipeline end-to-end. **Test-panel-only** by decision — nothing auto-emails until the firm enables an event. End-to-end email **verifies later** (needs Resend configured in Settings); dispatcher/bell/cron-auth are testable now.
- **Brand assets**: a `<Brand>` component (MQ **mark** / **horizontal** lockup; CSS light/dark swap isolated on the images so caller classes can't reveal both) wired into the sidebar, mobile login, and the (always-dark) auth panel; an **adaptive `app/icon.svg`** favicon (simplified MQ wordmark — the full logo mushes at tab size). Logos are fixed `public/` PNGs (R2 rejected for fixed assets).
- **Tests**: **Vitest** (`pnpm test`, **142 passing**) — RBAC matrix incl. the webmaster-only settings gate (`src/lib/rbac.test.ts`), lookups/statuses units, the audit filter-schema unit, **settings registry + datetime** units, **email-credential masking + schema** units, **upload policy** (mime/size/key builder, `src/lib/uploads.test.ts`), **directory schema** units (clients/suppliers/employees incl. employee HR fields, rate, typed-document + note schemas), and **notifications** units (`src/modules/notifications/domain.test.ts` recipient-rule/idempotency/backoff/channels, `schema.test.ts`, `src/lib/notification-events.test.ts` catalog integrity).

## What's built (Stage 2 — code side)

- **Schema** (`src/db/schema/{projects,project-members,phases,tasks,daily-reports}.ts`, migration `0012`): `projects` (PRJ ref code, `client_id`, `contract_amount` Money, `status` pgEnum, `progress_pct`/`progress_is_manual`, `lead_engineer_id` display-only, `defects_liability_until`, soft-delete); `project_members` (`role_on_project` text LEAD/MEMBER/INSPECTOR, **unique** `(project_id,user_id)`, index `(user_id,project_id)`); `phases`; `tasks` (`is_blocked`/`blocked_reason`, **stored** `is_delayed`/`delayed_notified_at`, **partial index** `(due_date) WHERE progress_pct<100`); `daily_reports` (DSR ref code, `status` pgEnum DRAFT/SUBMITTED, **unique** `(project_id,report_date)`) + `dsr_manpower`/`dsr_equipment`/`dsr_materials` (**stable uuid** = Stage-3 ledger `source_id`; `item_id` reserved, no FK yet)/`dsr_issues` (`severity` pgEnum). DSR **photos reuse the polymorphic `attachments` table** (`entity_type='daily_report'`) — no `dsr_photos`. `percentColumn` (numeric(5,2)) added to `src/lib/money.ts`; `progress_pct CHECK(0..100)` per table.
- **RBAC + scoping** (`src/lib/{roles,permissions,rbac}.ts`): `QA_QC_ENGINEER` added (visible, non-admin — **not** in Better Auth `adminRoles`; its power is `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`); `ENGINEER` gains scoped `task.manage` + `inspection.request`; reserved `inspection.*` keys. **`assertProjectAccess(exec,{userId,role,projectId})`** (write guard — admins bypass via `project.view.all`, else a `project_members` row, else `ActionError`→404) + **`projectAccessWhere(role,userId)`** (membership-baked read predicate). Designed `(app)/not-found.tsx` + `error.tsx`.
- **Projects** (`src/modules/projects/` + `/projects`, `/projects/[id]`): admin CRUD via `action()`, a pure status **state machine** (`canTransitionProject`/`allowedNextStatuses`; COMPLETED stamps `actual_end_date`), team assignment (1 LEAD + N MEMBER) reconciled on update (INSPECTOR grants untouched), scoped list + access-gated detail hub (Overview / Phases&Tasks / Daily Reports / Documents / Notes; docs+notes reuse the file/notes pipeline). Emits `project.created`/`project.status_changed`.
- **Phases & Tasks** (`src/modules/projects/tasks/`): phase/task CRUD scoped via `assertProjectAccess`; **on-write progress roll-up** in one tx (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` phase→project; phase = avg(tasks), project = avg(all tasks); skipped when `progress_is_manual`); task status **derived** (`deriveProgressStatus`), `completed_date` at 100, `is_delayed` reset on completion/re-date; narrow `task.update.progress` quick-path (assignee-or-manager). Phase-grouped list UI + inline progress popover.
- **Daily Site Reports** (`src/modules/projects/dsr/` + `/projects/[id]/dsr/[dsrId]`): **collision-safe** `resolveTodayDsr` (find-or-create today's DRAFT, one per project/date) with manpower+equipment **carry-forward**; debounced **autosave** (replace-set children, no audit noise); **submit** (DRAFT→SUBMITTED, requires work accomplished) emits `dsr.submitted` + `dsr.issue.flagged` (HIGH issue); **admin re-open** (audited); **photos upload-on-pick** via the attachments pipeline; multi-section editor (header + manpower/equipment/materials/issues field arrays + photo gallery), full read-only when submitted/non-author.
- **Notifications dispatcher** (`src/modules/notifications/service.ts`): now resolves **`PROJECT:*`** recipients via `project_members` (LEAD vs full team) and **excludes the actor** (`payload.actorId`) — no self-notifications. `project.*`/`dsr.*` events seeded **inert**.
- **Crons** (`CRON_SECRET`-guarded, `vercel.json`): **`/api/cron/tasks-delayed`** flips newly past-due open tasks `is_delayed` false→true once and emits `task.delayed` (idempotent via the transition flag re-checked under `FOR UPDATE` + outbox idempotencyKey; the emit omits `entityId` so a re-slip re-notifies); **`/api/cron/files-reaper`** sweeps abandoned `PENDING` files (best-effort R2 delete + row drop).
- **Tests** (+27, 142 total): project state-machine + `normalizeTeam`, task `round2`/`isTaskDelayed`/`shouldClearDelayed`/`blockedReasonOk`, DSR `hasHighSeverityIssue`, project/task/DSR schema units (Better-Auth-id vs uuid, blocked-reason rule, material-needs-description, qty coercion), and the Stage 2 RBAC matrix (`QA_QC_ENGINEER` bundle, `ENGINEER` scoped `task.manage`, admin firm-wide reach).

Routes today: `/` → `/dashboard` (gated → `/login`); `/users`, `/audit`, `/clients`, `/clients/[id]`, `/suppliers`, `/employees`, `/employees/[id]`, **`/projects`, `/projects/[id]`, `/projects/[id]/dsr/[dsrId]`** (project pages are admin- **or** assigned-engineer-scoped; an unauthorized id 404s); `/settings` (webmaster-only). `(app)` pages render as Partial Prerender (◐); the optimistic `proxy.ts` redirects unauthenticated requests. Real HTTP routes: `/api/auth/[...all]` and the `CRON_SECRET`-guarded `/api/cron/{notifications,tasks-delayed,files-reaper}` jobs.

## Stage 0 gate — ✅ CLOSED

Done against the live DB:

1. **Services provisioned** + `.env.local` filled: Neon (pooled + unpooled URLs), `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `SEED_WEBMASTER_*` / `SEED_ADMIN_*`. Resend/R2/CRON still deferred until the notifications/files features need them.
2. **Migrated**: `pnpm db:migrate` applied (incl. `0001` audit append-only trigger), via the **unpooled** URL.
3. **Seeded**: `pnpm db:seed` created the hidden webmaster + admin; both sign in at `/login`.
4. **Acceptance check** ([`docs/16`](docs/16-tech-decisions.md) §2) passed: a multi-statement `db.transaction()` **and** a prepared-heavy query both succeed against the **pooled** URL.

_Ongoing per-stage (not a gate):_ the full domain schema ([`docs/02`](docs/02-data-model.md)) + modules land stage by stage, with **Vitest + Playwright** added alongside (ledger/money/rbac units + login e2e). The `stock_ledger` append-only trigger lands with Stage 3.

## How to run

```bash

## Invariants — do not break (full list in `CLAUDE.md`)

- **Driver**: app → `postgres-js` pooled `prepare:false`; migrations → unpooled; **never** `neon-http`.
- **Dynamic by default**; `use cache` only for settings + admin report aggregates; session reads stay out of cache and inside `<Suspense>`.
- **All mutations** go through the guarded `action()` Server Action wrapper. No public signup.
- **Session reads:** the cookie cache (60s) serves the **read** gate; the `action()` **write** guard uses `getFreshSession()` (fresh DB). **Deactivation-revoke contract (implemented):** `deactivateUserAction` deletes the target's `session` rows in the same transaction, so a cached cookie can't outlive a disabled account beyond 60s (docs/17 §3). Any future user-disabling path must do the same.
- **Ledger & audit log are append-only**; money is `DECIMAL(14,2)`, never float.
- Double-submit safety, designed empty/loading/error states, no dead code.
