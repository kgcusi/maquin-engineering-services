# 04 — Module Specifications

One spec per module. Each lists: **Purpose**, **Key data** (→ [02](02-data-model.md)), **Screens**,
**Rules** (the logic that must be enforced server-side), **Events** emitted (→
[08](08-notifications.md)), **Permissions** (→ [03](03-roles-and-permissions.md)), and
**Done when** (acceptance criteria for the build).

Modules are numbered to match the proposal (§5.1–§5.21).

---

## Core System

### 5.1 User & Authentication
**Purpose.** Accounts, login/logout, role-based access, active/inactive status.

**Key data.** `users`, `roles`/`permissions`, sessions.

**Screens.** Login · Users list (admin) · Create/edit user · Change-password / profile · "Account inactive" notice.

**Rules.**
- No public sign-up; admins create users. First admin via seed.
- Passwords hashed (Argon2id/bcrypt); enforce a minimum strength.
- Inactive users cannot authenticate; active sessions for a deactivated user are invalidated.
- Failed-login rate limiting; generic error messages (no "user not found" leak).
- Session via HTTP-only secure cookie; CSRF protection on mutations.
- Deactivate, never hard-delete (history depends on the user row).

**Events.** `user.created`, `user.deactivated`, `auth.login.failed` (×N → optional alert).

**Permissions.** `user.*`.

**Done when.** Admin can create an engineer who can log in, see only their projects, and be
deactivated; a deactivated user is locked out immediately.

---

### 5.2 Audit Trail / Activity Logs
**Purpose.** Immutable record of important actions.

**Key data.** `audit_logs` ([02](02-data-model.md) §2.3).

**Screens.** Audit log viewer with filters (actor, action, entity type, date range) and a
per-entity "history" panel surfaced on detail pages.

**Rules.**
- Append-only; no edit/delete in the UI or API.
- Logged actions (minimum): project create/update, DSR submit, MR approve/reject, release,
  site receiving, expense approve/reject, stock adjustment, damage/loss posting, notification
  send, user create/deactivate, login failures.
- Capture actor, action key, entity ref, a human summary, and a `diff` of changed fields.
- Writing the audit row is part of the same transaction as the action it records.

**Events.** none (it consumes events/actions).

**Permissions.** `audit.view` (Admin).

**Done when.** Approving an MR produces an immutable log row visible in the viewer and on the
MR's history panel, with before/after status.

Full detail: [12-audit-trail.md](12-audit-trail.md).

---

### 5.3 System Settings
**Purpose.** Admin-editable reusable option lists + app configuration.

**Key data.** Lookup tables ([02](02-data-model.md) §2.4): `project_statuses`, `task_statuses`,
`inventory_categories`, `units`, `budget_categories`, `expense_categories`, `employee_trades`,
`cashflow_categories`; plus `app_settings`, `notification_settings`.

**Screens.** Settings hub → one manager per list (CRUD, reorder, activate/deactivate) ·
Company/app settings (name, timezone, currency, logo) · Notification settings ·
SMTP test panel.

**Rules.**
- A lookup value in use cannot be hard-deleted; it can be deactivated (hidden from new pickers,
  preserved on historical records).
- `code` is unique per list and immutable once referenced.
- Seed sensible defaults so the system is usable on day one.
- Changing currency/timezone is a guarded action (affects display across the app).

**Events.** `settings.updated` (optional audit only).

**Permissions.** `settings.view`, `settings.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** Admin adds a new expense category and it appears in the expense form; a category
already used by an expense cannot be deleted, only deactivated.

---

### 5.4 Notifications / Email Updates
> Specified in depth in [08-notifications.md](08-notifications.md); summarized here for scope.

**Purpose.** SMTP email (and optional in-app) alerts for critical events.

**Key data.** `notifications`, `notification_settings`.

**Screens.** Notification settings (per-event toggle, recipients rule, digest vs immediate) ·
In-app bell/inbox · SMTP test.

**Rules.** Event-driven; per-event enable/disable; recipient resolution by role + project
assignment; retries on SMTP failure; email failure never breaks the source action; every send
recorded.

**Events (consumes).** `material_request.*`, `task.delayed`, `stock.low`, `dsr.submitted`,
`approval.pending`, `phase.critical_update`, etc.

**Permissions.** `notification.settings.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** Approving an MR emails the requester via SMTP, the send is recorded, and a
failed send is retried and surfaced — without rolling back the approval.

---

## Directory

### 5.5 Employee / Workforce Directory
**Purpose.** Reference list of people in project operations (who reported/received/worked).

**Key data.** `employees`, `employee_trades`.

**Screens.** Employee list (search/filter by trade/status) · Create/edit · Employee detail
(appearances in DSR manpower, receipts).

**Rules.** Soft-delete; an employee referenced by reports/receipts cannot be hard-deleted.
Optional link to a `users` account.

**Permissions.** `employee.view`, `employee.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** An employee can be created, picked in a DSR's manpower list, and their site
appearances are visible on their detail page.

---

### 5.6 Clients
**Purpose.** Client records with contacts, documents, notes, and project history.

**Key data.** `clients`, `client_documents`, `client_notes`, derived projects.

**Screens.** Client list · Create/edit · Client detail (tabs: Info, Documents, Notes, Projects).

**Rules.** Soft-delete; client with projects can't be hard-deleted. Project history is derived,
not stored.

**Permissions.** `client.view`, `client.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** Creating a project for a client makes that project appear under the client's
Projects tab.

---

### 5.7 Suppliers / Vendors
**Purpose.** Suppliers used in stock-in and expenses.

**Key data.** `suppliers`.

**Screens.** Supplier list · Create/edit · Supplier detail (linked stock-ins and expenses).

**Rules.** Soft-delete; referenced suppliers can't be hard-deleted.

**Permissions.** `supplier.view`, `supplier.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** A supplier can be chosen on a stock-in and an expense, and both appear on the
supplier's detail page.

---

## Projects

### 5.8 Project Management
**Purpose.** Create and monitor projects.

**Key data.** `projects`, `project_documents`, `project_members`.

**Screens.** Projects list (status, progress, client, engineer) · Create/edit · Project
detail hub (Overview, Phases/Tasks, Daily Reports, Budget, Expenses, Cash Flow, Materials,
Documents).

**Rules.**
- Assigning `lead_engineer_id` is what grants the engineer access (scoping rule, [03](03-roles-and-permissions.md) §4).
- `progress_pct` either rolls up from tasks (recommended) or is set manually — choose one and
  be consistent; document it on the project.
- Status transitions follow the configured `project_statuses`; setting `Completed` requires an
  `actual_end_date`.
- Contract amount and budget are distinct (contract = client price; budget = planned cost).

**Events.** `project.created`, `project.status_changed`, `project.completed`.

**Permissions.** `project.create/update/delete`, `project.view.all` / `project.view.assigned`.

**Done when.** Admin creates a project, assigns an engineer, and that engineer sees it on their
dashboard while other engineers do not.

---

### 5.9 Project Phases & Tasks
**Purpose.** Break a project into Phases → Tasks to track progress, timeline, delays.

**Key data.** `phases`, `tasks`, `task_attachments`.

**Screens.** Phase/task board or list inside the project (grouped by phase) · Create/edit
phase · Create/edit task · Task detail (status, dates, progress, remarks, attachments).

**Rules.**
- Hierarchy: Project → Phase → Task.
- `is_delayed` is derived: `due_date < today AND status ≠ Done`. Recomputed on read and by a
  daily job that emits `task.delayed` once per newly-delayed task.
- Phase progress = weighted/avg of its tasks; project progress rolls up from phases (if using
  derived progress).
- Completing all tasks in a phase can auto-complete the phase (configurable).

**Events.** `task.delayed`, `phase.completed`, `phase.critical_update` (admin-flagged).

**Permissions.** `task.manage` (Admin), `task.update.progress` (Engineer on assigned).

**Done when.** A task past its due date and not done shows as delayed, appears in the delayed-
tasks dashboard widget, and triggers one delay notification.

---

### 5.10 Daily Site Reports (DSR)
**Purpose.** Dated record of site activity: weather, work done, manpower, equipment, materials
used, photos, issues, next-day plan, progress.

**Key data.** `daily_reports` + `dsr_manpower` / `dsr_equipment` / `dsr_materials` /
`dsr_photos` / `dsr_issues`.

**Screens.** DSR list per project (by date) · Create/submit DSR (multi-section form) · DSR
detail (read view with photo gallery) · "My reports" for engineers.

**Rules.**
- One submitted DSR per project per date (`UNIQUE(project_id, report_date)`); a second is an
  edit, not a new row.
- `DRAFT` is editable by its author; `SUBMITTED` locks editing (re-open is an admin/logged
  action).
- `dsr_materials` rows linked to an `item_id` are the **usage** signal for inventory
  accounting — on submit, the system posts `USAGE` ledger rows (or stages them for confirmation;
  choose per [06](06-inventory-ledger.md) §6 and document it).
- Photos go to object storage; enforce type/size limits.
- Submitting updates the project/phase progress note feed.

**Events.** `dsr.submitted`, `dsr.issue.flagged` (for high-severity issues).

**Permissions.** `dsr.create`, `dsr.update.own`, `dsr.view`/`dsr.view.all`.

**Done when.** An engineer submits a DSR with materials used; those quantities reduce remaining
material for the project and appear in the issued/used/remaining report.

---

## Finance — full detail in [07-finance-design.md](07-finance-design.md)

### 5.11 Budget & Expenses
**Purpose.** Planned budget vs. actual expenses per project.

**Key data.** `budgets`, `budget_lines`, `expenses`, `expense_attachments`.

**Screens.** Project Budget (categorized lines, total) · Budget revision · Expenses list
(filter by category/status/date) · Create expense (with receipt upload) · Expense approval
queue.

**Rules.**
- Only **APPROVED** expenses count as actual cost (pending/rejected excluded from budget-vs-
  actual).
- An expense may link to a `budget_line` to compare actual vs planned per category.
- Expense creation triggers an approval ([5.12](#512-approvals)); approval flips status and
  records `approved_by`.
- Money math per [07](07-finance-design.md) (integer/decimal, never float).
- Budget revision creates a new `version`, supersedes the prior, and is itself an approvable
  `BUDGET_ADJUSTMENT`.

**Events.** `expense.submitted`, `expense.approved`, `expense.rejected`, `budget.exceeded`
(actual > budget threshold).

**Permissions.** `budget.manage`, `expense.create`, `expense.approve`.

**Done when.** Submitting an expense creates a pending approval; once approved it appears in
budget-vs-actual and updates the project's actual cost and dashboard.

---

### 5.12 Cash Flow
**Purpose.** Track money in (client payments, billings) and out (suppliers, rentals,
subcontractors).

**Key data.** `cashflow_tx`, `cashflow_categories`.

**Screens.** Cash flow ledger per project (and firm-wide) · Add inflow/outflow · Cash position
summary (in − out, running balance).

**Rules.**
- `direction` (IN/OUT) + positive `amount`; never store signed amounts.
- Optional link to project, client, or supplier.
- Cash position = Σ(IN) − Σ(OUT) for the scope; running balance ordered by `tx_date`.
- Cash flow is **separate** from expenses: an expense is a cost; a cash OUT is a payment. They
  may relate but are tracked independently to keep the model honest. (Document the firm's
  convention if they want them linked.)

**Events.** `cashflow.recorded` (audit/optional).

**Permissions.** `cashflow.view`, `cashflow.manage` (Admin).

**Done when.** Recording a client payment (IN) and a supplier payment (OUT) updates the
project's cash position and the cash-flow report.

---

### 5.13 Approvals
**Purpose.** Gate critical transactions: material requests, expenses, budget adjustments,
inventory adjustments, damaged items, lost/missing materials.

**Key data.** `approvals` (polymorphic, [02](02-data-model.md) §6).

**Screens.** Unified Approvals inbox (filter by type/status) · Approval detail with the subject
embedded and Approve/Reject (+ note) actions.

**Rules.**
- State machine: `PENDING → APPROVED | REJECTED`; `PENDING → CANCELLED` by requester.
- The **effect** of the transaction happens only on approval (stock isn't released, expense
  isn't counted, adjustment isn't posted until then), inside one transaction.
- Reject requires a `decision_note`.
- Approver ≠ requester is enforceable (configurable for small teams).
- Approving/rejecting emits a notification to the requester and writes audit + (if applicable)
  ledger rows atomically.

**Events.** `approval.pending` (to approvers), `approval.decided` (to requester).

**Permissions.** `approval.view`, `approval.decide` (Admin).

**Done when.** One inbox shows all pending items across types; approving a material-request
approval releases nothing by itself but unlocks the release step, while approving an inventory
adjustment posts the ledger movement.

Full state machine: [05-core-flows.md](05-core-flows.md) §5.

---

## Inventory — full detail in [06-inventory-ledger.md](06-inventory-ledger.md)

### 5.14 Inventory Master Data
**Purpose.** Items and locations.

**Key data.** `items`, `locations`, `inventory_categories`, `units`.

**Screens.** Items list (category, unit, on-hand, reorder level) · Create/edit item ·
Locations list/edit.

**Rules.** Soft-delete items; referenced items deactivate, not delete. `reorder_level` drives
low-stock detection. A `SITE` location may link to a project. On-hand is read from
`item_stock_balances`, never typed by hand (except via an audited adjustment).

**Events.** none directly (low-stock is detected on balance change / by job).

**Permissions.** `item.manage`, `location.manage` (Admin); `item.view` broader.

**Done when.** Creating an item with a reorder level makes it eligible for low-stock alerts and
selectable across stock-in/requests.

---

### 5.15 Inventory Stock-In
**Purpose.** Record materials received into inventory.

**Key data.** `stock_ins`, `stock_in_lines`, → `stock_ledger`.

**Screens.** Stock-in list · New stock-in (supplier, location, received-by, date, invoice
upload, line items with qty + unit cost) · Stock-in detail.

**Rules.**
- Posting writes one **positive** `STOCK_IN` ledger row per line and bumps
  `item_stock_balances` for the receiving location — atomically.
- `unit_cost` snapshots onto the ledger for valuation.
- Crossing back **above** reorder level can clear a low-stock flag.

**Events.** `stockin.recorded`.

**Permissions.** `stockin.create` (Admin).

**Done when.** Recording a stock-in raises the item's on-hand at the chosen location and shows
in the item ledger with the supplier and cost.

---

### 5.16 Material Requests (MR)
**Purpose.** Engineers request materials for a project.

**Key data.** `material_requests`, `mr_lines`, `approvals`.

**Screens.** MR list (status) · New MR (project, needed date, purpose, line items) · MR detail
(approval state, released qty per line) · Approval view (admin).

**Rules.**
- Engineer creates MR for an assigned project → status `PENDING` with an `approvals` row.
- Admin approves/rejects; on approval, `qty_approved` is set (may differ from requested) and
  status enables release.
- Partial release supported: status moves `APPROVED → PARTIALLY_RELEASED → RELEASED` as
  `qty_released` accrues.
- An MR does not move stock; **release** does.

**Events.** `material_request.submitted` (→ approvers), `material_request.approved` /
`.rejected` / `.released` (→ requester), `stock.low` may fire downstream.

**Permissions.** `mr.create` (Engineer/Admin), `mr.approve` (Admin).

**Done when.** An engineer submits an MR, admin approves it, and it becomes available for
release with the approved quantities.

---

### 5.17 Inventory Release & Site Receiving
**Purpose.** Issue approved materials and confirm what actually arrived on site.

**Key data.** `releases`, `release_lines`, `site_receipts`, `site_receipt_lines`, →
`stock_ledger`.

**Screens.** Release form (against an approved MR; pick source location + qty per line) ·
Release detail · Site receiving form (engineer confirms received qty, flags shortage/damage,
uploads proof) · Discrepancy view.

**Rules.**
- Release requires sufficient on-hand at the source; posts **negative** `RELEASE` ledger rows
  and decrements balances atomically. Updates `mr_lines.qty_released`.
- Site receiving posts a **positive** `RECEIPT` ledger row at the site location (if sites are
  tracked) and records shortages (`released − received`). A shortage opens a discrepancy and may
  spawn a `LOSS`/`DAMAGE` movement requiring approval.
- Proof attachments stored in object storage.

**Events.** `release.created`, `receiving.confirmed`, `receiving.discrepancy`.

**Permissions.** `release.create` (Admin), `receiving.confirm` (Engineer/Admin at their site).

**Done when.** Releasing against an approved MR lowers warehouse on-hand; the engineer confirms
receipt with a shortage, and the shortage is visible as a discrepancy and reflected in
issued/received figures.

---

### 5.18 Inventory Movements & Adjustments
**Purpose.** Returns, transfers, damaged, wasted, lost/missing, and manual adjustments.

**Key data.** `inventory_movements`, `approvals`, → `stock_ledger`.

**Screens.** Movement list (by type/status) · New movement (type-specific form) · Adjustment
form (with mandatory reason) · Approval view for damage/waste/loss/adjustment.

**Rules.**
- **Return:** site → warehouse; positive at destination, negative at source.
- **Transfer:** location → location; `TRANSFER_OUT` (−) and `TRANSFER_IN` (+) as a pair.
- **Damage / Waste / Loss:** negative at source; **require approval** before posting; reason +
  proof mandatory.
- **Adjustment:** manual correction to match a physical count; **requires approval**; reason
  mandatory; posts a signed `ADJUSTMENT` row equal to (counted − system).
- Approval-gated types stay `PENDING` and post to the ledger only on approval.

**Events.** `movement.created`, `movement.pending` (→ approvers), `movement.posted`.

**Permissions.** `movement.create`, `movement.approve` (Admin).

**Done when.** A damaged-materials movement waits for approval, and only upon approval reduces
on-hand and appears in the ledger and the damaged/lost report.

---

### 5.19 Inventory Traceability / Ledger
**Purpose.** Full movement history for any item — who requested, approved, released, received,
used, returned, transferred, damaged, wasted, lost.

**Key data.** `stock_ledger` (read), joined to source records and actors.

**Screens.** Item ledger (chronological, signed quantities, running balance, actor, source
link) · Project material trail · Global movement search (by item, location, date, type, person).

**Rules.**
- Pure read over the append-only ledger; never mutated here.
- Every row deep-links to its source (stock-in, release, DSR, movement) and its actor.
- Running balance computed in query order.

**Events.** none.

**Permissions.** `ledger.view`.

**Done when.** Selecting an item shows every movement with the responsible person and a link to
the originating document, and the running balance matches current on-hand.

Full design: [06-inventory-ledger.md](06-inventory-ledger.md).

---

## Management Output

### 5.20 Reports & Export
**Purpose.** Management reports with filters and PDF/Excel/CSV export.

**Key data.** Read queries/views over operational tables.

**Reports.** Project progress · Daily site report · Budget vs actual · Expense · Cash flow ·
Inventory movement · Issued vs used vs remaining · Project used materials · Low stock ·
Damaged/lost materials · Timeline delay · Employee activity.

**Rules.** Read-only; respect role scope (engineers → their projects only); consistent filter
bar (date range, project, category…); export preserves the filtered result; large exports
stream/paginate.

**Permissions.** `report.view`, `report.export` (scoped for engineers).

**Done when.** Each report renders with filters and exports to PDF, Excel, and CSV matching the
on-screen data.

Full catalog & query strategy: [09-reports-and-export.md](09-reports-and-export.md).

---

### 5.21 Dashboard
**Purpose.** At-a-glance summary cards and tables.

**Key data.** Aggregations across projects, tasks, approvals, finance, inventory.

**Widgets.** Active projects · Delayed tasks · Pending approvals · Budget usage · Total
expenses · Cash position · Low-stock items · Recent daily reports · Recent inventory movements.

**Rules.** Role-aware (admin = firm-wide; engineer = assigned projects); each widget deep-links
to its source list; computed from read queries (cached where heavy).

**Permissions.** `dashboard.admin` / `dashboard.engineer`.

**Done when.** Admin sees firm-wide cards that match the underlying reports; an engineer sees
only their projects' figures.

Full design: [10-dashboard.md](10-dashboard.md).
